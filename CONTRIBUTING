```

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the [Infr Desktop Client repository](https://github.com/InfrHQ/client).

2.  **Create a Feature Branch:** After cloning your fork locally, create a new branch for your feature or bugfix. This helps in keeping the master branch clean and also enables easy tracking of your contributions.
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name
```

3.  **Commit your Changes:** Make your changes, and write a meaningful commit message. We follow certain [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).

```

5.  **Create a Pull Request:** Head over to the 'Pull requests' tab of the main repository and click on 'New Pull Request'. Select your fork from the dropdown and the branch you wish to merge. Then, create a pull request.

## Commit Message Guidelines

-   Start with a verb in the present tense. Example: "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove".
-   Use a brief summary (50 chars or less) in the first line.
-   Optionally, follow it with a blank line and a more detailed description.
-   Reference any relevant issues or pull requests, e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Related to #456".

Example:
```
Add search functionality to the dashboard  This commit introduces a search box and filters to allow users to search through their data. Fixes #123.
```
